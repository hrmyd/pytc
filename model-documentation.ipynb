    "##Basic model pipeline\n",
    "The basic procedure for all ITC experiments is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a model.\n",
    "2. Guess model parameters (which will always include at least one binding constant and reaction enthalpy).  \n",
    "3. Use the guessed binding constant(s) to calculate the concentrations of all molecular species over the course of the experiment.\n",
    "4. Combine the estimated species concentrations with the guessed enthalpy(s) to calculate the heat change for each shot. \n",
    "5. Compare the calculated and measured heat changes at each shot.  \n",
    "6. Iterate through steps 2-5 using nonlinear regression to find maximum likelihood parameter estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Differences from other modeling approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "The models used py `pytc` differ from models in packages like Origin in several ways:\n",
    "1. The dilution correction is a fittable parameter within each model, treated as a linear function of titrant concentration.  To incorporate a blank titration, you globally fit the dilution for the blank and production experiments as a single pair of parameters (slope and intercept).  \n",
    "2. Dilution is accounted for up front in all calculations of species concentration, rather than being accounted for implicitly by a volume correction to the observed heats. "
